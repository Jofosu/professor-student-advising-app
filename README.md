#Team 2A


This prototype allows the user to manage advisees by adding and deleting
students as well as manage the department course catalogue in the same 
fashion. The user can also list requirements for a major as well as the 
prerequisites of any entered course. As well as mark what classes a student
has taken.

Some limitations of the interface itself include the preservation of the 
dynamic state. The app doesn't crash when the screen is rotated, but it does 
revert back to the log in screen. Some  of the screens have buttons that are 
inaccessible after rotating to landscape view. 

We originally planned for students to enter their own courses, however, because 
we struggled to differentiate between different users. We left that for the 
advisor to handle. We also stripped the schedule planning feature.
