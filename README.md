#Team 2A


This prototype allows the user to manage advisees by adding and deleting
students as well as manage the department course catalogue in the same 
fashion. One of the limitations is that the persistent data isn't associated
with specific login credentials, so anyone who logs in has access to every
advisee in the database and also the ability to edit the course catalog. 
The app also crashes when nothing is entered in the username field. 

Some limitations of the interface itself include the preservation of the 
dynamic state and inaccessibility of buttons. The app doesn't crash when 
the screen is rotated, but it does revert back to the log in screen. Some 
of the screens have buttons that are inaccessible after rotating to 
landscape view. 

There is currently no functionality implemented for a student user of the
application.
