# Academic Advisor

###Introduction 
We envision an Android application capable of
handling the academic advising needs of both
advisors and advisees by assisting in schedule
planning and course selection. This addresses
a large need as the current AskBanner system
leads to confusion.

**This will be an improvement by:**
1. Allowing advisors to have all their advisees in one place to easily keep track of them
2. Allowing students to make a living schedule that allows for long term planing with flexibility
3. Track progress through a major
4. Alert to any class conflicts due to it not being offered


###Key feature summary:

Class tracking

Schedule Making

Managing Advisees

Manage Offered Classes

###Stakeholder Goals
Advisees- make a class schedule, add classes taken, check progress towards major

Advisors- add advisee, remove advisee, check advisee progress

Department Head- add courses, add major requirements
